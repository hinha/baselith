# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the baselith project requirements.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Cross-Platform CLI Application (✅ Complete)
- Created a Go-based command-line application using the Cobra framework
- Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms
- Includes multiple commands:
  - Root command: Welcome message
  - `version`: Display application version
  - `greet`: Greet a person by name (with `-n` or `--name` flag)

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows (✅ Complete)

#### PR Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`)
Triggers on pull requests to the `main` branch:
- **Test Job**: Runs unit tests and generates coverage report
- **Build Job**: Builds the application for all three platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- All build artifacts are uploaded for review

#### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
Triggers when a new release is created:
- Builds the application for all platforms
- Runs unit tests on each platform
- Executes the compiled binary to verify functionality (mock test)
- Uploads release assets automatically

### 3. Testing (✅ Complete)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all commands
- Tests verify output correctness
- Tests pass successfully on all commands
- Coverage tracking enabled in PR workflow

### 4. Project Structure (✅ Complete)

```

## Manual Configuration Required

### Branch Protection Rules (⚠️ Requires Manual Setup)

Since branch protection rules cannot be configured via code, they must be set up manually in the GitHub repository settings:

**Steps to Configure:**

1. Navigate to repository **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule** or **Add branch protection rule**
3. Enter `main` as the branch name pattern
4. Enable the following settings:
   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ✅ **Require approvals**: Set to **1** (minimum)
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - ✅ Select status checks: `Unit Tests` and `Build Cross-Platform`
   - ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging** (recommended)
5. Click **Create** or **Save changes**

**Result**: After configuration, you will only be able to merge PRs to `main` after:
- At least 1 approval
- All status checks (tests and builds) pass

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build the application
go build -o baselith .

# Run the application
./baselith
./baselith version
./baselith greet -n "World"

# Run tests
go test ./... -v

# Build for different platforms
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o baselith-linux-amd64 .
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o baselith-darwin-amd64 .
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o baselith-windows-amd64.exe .
```

### GitHub Actions Testing

1. **Test PR Workflow**: Create a pull request to the `main` branch
   - The workflow will automatically run tests and build for all platforms
   - Check the Actions tab to see the workflow progress

2. **Test Release Workflow**: Create a new release
   - Go to Releases → Draft a new release
   - Create a new tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   - Publish the release
   - The workflow will build, test, and upload binaries automatically

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Cross-platform CLI application created with Cobra  
✅ Unit tests implemented and passing  
✅ PR workflow runs tests and builds for Linux/macOS/Windows  
✅ Release workflow builds, tests, and uploads assets for all platforms  
✅ Documentation updated with usage instructions  
⚠️ Branch protection requires manual GitHub settings configuration

## Additional Notes

- All Go dependencies are managed via `go.mod` and `go.sum`
- The application is fully cross-platform compatible
- GitHub Actions use latest stable versions of actions
- Build artifacts are preserved for 90 days (GitHub default)
- Release assets are uploaded automatically to each release
